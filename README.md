 ðŸ“ˆ Stock Aggregator App â€“ Beginner Project Highlight
As a frontend beginner, I recently built a Stock Price Aggregation Web App using React. This small project helped me practice some key React concepts while also understanding how to fetch and display real-time stock data.

ðŸ”§ Key React Concepts I Focused On:
âœ… Component Structure:
I broke down the app into reusable components like:

StockPage â€“ to show the stock data

Heatmap â€“ to visualize correlation


âœ… State Management with useState:
I used useState to manage things like:

fetched stock data

loading and error states

selected stock symbols

âœ… Data Fetching with useEffect:
To fetch stock prices and update them on component load, I used useEffect. Initially, I struggled with async calls and got a few errors. But I learned how to handle those better by exploring best practices and applying

âœ… API Integration Challenges:
As a beginner, I found it tricky to correctly fetch data from stock exchange APIs. I got stuck with error handling and mapping API responses. Eventually, I used the response I received here and tried to understand and adapt it myself.

ðŸŒ± Beginner Learning Note
Even though the final version works because of some help, Iâ€™m proud that I could break it down and apply the logic. I'm not yet perfect, but Iâ€™ve learned a lot about:

breaking a problem into components

working with APIs

debugging errors

thinking in React ðŸš€

ðŸ§  Next Goals:
Improve form handling and validation

Learn how to cache API responses

Add charts with Recharts or Chart.js
 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
